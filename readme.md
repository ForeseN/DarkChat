# DarkChat

DarkChat is a chat site handled by SocketIO which is a library that enables event-based communication between clients and a server. For the backend, I chose Flask as my module. It handles the all the interaction with the user - login, register, contact, verification and everything that is backend. For the Database I used SQLAlchemy which can easly work with Flask. DarkChat has a Login page, Register page, Contact page and a Chat page.

# Setup

Ensure you have the latest Python installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Running the Server

Simply run main.py
